LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/data_clock/state_reg[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/data_clock/state_reg[1]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[0]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[0]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

The latch spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/data_store_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/data_store_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#64 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/data_store_reg[9] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/data_store_reg[9]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#65 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[0]/L7 (in spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[0] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[0]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#66 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin spi_max_i/spi_tx_w_0/inst/mspi/state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 66 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
